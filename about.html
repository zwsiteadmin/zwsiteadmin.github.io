            <p> Strategic thinking is a valuable skill that helps you plan, prioritize, and make decisions that align with your long-term goals. Here are some key principles and how you can apply them in everyday life.</p>
            <p> Have a clear vision of what you want to achieve and set specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Whether it's career advancement, personal growth, or financial planning, outline your desired outcomes and break them into smaller, manageable steps.</p>
            <p> Understand the internal and external factors that can affect your goals. This includes strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis). For example, if youâ€™re planning to switch careers, assess your current skills, identify the new skills you need, and evaluate job market trends.</p>
